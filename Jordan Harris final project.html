<p>
My name is Jordan  Harris, son of Erica Harris and Willie Hopkins. I graduated from Seminole County High in May of 2016. Also I think it is important that I was the first male that attended Seminole County High to sign a National Letter of Intent to a Division one college institution. I am undecided in my major currently, because I have more than one interest. I am highly interested in both of these two fields: Fashion Merchandising and Sports Management. I am passionate about clothes and shoes, and would love a chance to be apart of different fashion and try to find ways to improve fashion for all genders. I am also passionate about sports, I have been involved with different sports my entire life. I played football, basketball, and baseball growing up since the age of eight, and I would love to pursue a job dealing with sports. Some goals I have not met yet are simple: receiving a degree from the University of Georgia, finding my career or something I am interested in (other than basketball), getting married, and also have kids one day and be a good role model for them.
